subtitle: "Mobile application specialist is a complex process that has many different risk but the major risks of my venture are \n\n•\tTechnology Risk\n\n•\tMarket Risk\n\n•\tFinancial Risk\n\n•\tTeam Risk\n\n•\tGovernment Risk\n\n\n\n1.\tTechnology Risk: As technology evolves and becomes more popular in daily work for all kind of businesses because people want to use current technology. Without using latest technology, my venture will not get success, so I think this is the major risk of my venture. The main technology threat of my business is security framework. In addition, my organisation faces other technological risks like hardware problem, software problem and equipment failure.\n\n2.\tMarket Risk: Market risk is the another sort of risk for my venture and I believe that it is very difficult to compete with other organisations in the market. To fulfill customers’ requirements are creating some troubles in my business due to lack of technical knowledge of the customers. Improper analysis of customer needs results in loss of the revenue and also affects the quality of applications and services.\n\n3.\tFinancial Risk: Mobile application specialist also have financial risk because everything is dependent on cost. To start-up a business, I have to spend huge money but it will not sure I will earn money as I spent. Financial risk is also created by increasing competition, revenue growth uncertainty and tax rate.\n\n4.\tTeam Risk: Human resources or employees are important to gain profit in business. But if team members have some sort of conflicts related to different views on same idea, they will not do work with cooperation and it will create problem of team risk. Furthermore, some team members can be share legal information of my company with other organisations for getting more money from it, this will lead towards big risk of team or my company privacy.   \n\n5.\tGovernment Risk: Government implements numerous rules and regulation to start-up a new business and it can easily reject permit of my business due to some uncertainty.  Sometimes government added or imposed new taxes on businesses and it also changes certain laws at any time then it will effect on business. So, I consider it is another risk of my venture."
